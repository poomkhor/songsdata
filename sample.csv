You've got to move it to the beat
You've got to move it to the rhythm
You've got to stomp your feet to the beat

Move it to the rhythm
You've got to move it to the beat
You've got to move it to the rhythm
You've got to move your feet, stomp that beat

We oughta really get it on, get it on, get it on
We gotta get it on
We really got it goin' on, goin' on
We got it goin' on
Move your feet to the beat and keep on
Too heater than sweet to sleep on
So you go on and on, all night long
'Till dawn, you can't get it wrong
You just move around like you really don't care
Hands in the air and keep'em there
Side to side you just let 'em sway
Through the day, let the music play
Hear the rythm, move to the pace
Get to the bass and shake up the place
It don't matter what you are doin'
It's how you do it and how you flewin'
So keep on goin' for a while
Keep 'em goin' into the style
I took the hook that everybody done grinnin'
Now look at your body, move to the rythm !

Move to the rhythm, groove with the flow
You know how it goes, now what you got to show
Pump it up like it ain't nothing
Jump around to the sound we bring
And you can't miss the count or lose the beat
You do it all the time, you don't stop your feet
Move it to the rhythm of the song
Everybody party once along
Get on the floor where the action is
You can it down about your business
When I'm old I hope to be sold
The truth unfold and the stories told
If you're willing to say no more
Get down for shockin' n' rockin' the floor
Move it to the rythm, groove with the flow
You know what you got to show, now let's go !You might also likeEmbed"
